If you've ever wanted to complete guide to building your next application on AWS, this is the repo for you.

> üóíÔ∏è This repo is part of a YouTube video that describes how each of the various pieces are built and deployed.

## Overview

This repo brings together [core AWS services that every app needs](https://youtube.com/shorts/DfwhE6yXcCM?si=ds2hBN2Ia2pIfdC3):

- AWS Cognito: Allows user signups, forgot password, and more
- AWS AppSync: A managed GraphQL service that provides websockets out of the box
- Amazon DynamoDB: Database layer
- Amazon Bedrock: AI LLM service

All of these services are located in their own folder in the `backend` directory. They then come together in the `lib/backendStack.ts` file.

In addition, this comes with a frontend that uses NextJS, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and Amplify Libraries.

This is completely built with TypeScript on both the NextJS side and the AWS CDK side.
